# Lighthouse Viewer Monorepository

This is a monorepo-multipackage managed with Lerna to publish to NPM the following packages:

- [lighthouse-viewer](./packages/lighthouse-viewer): The extracted sourcecode originally from [lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse). [Online demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/lighthouse-viewer-vanillajs-demo-zw2bj)
- [react2-lighthouse-viewer](./packages/react2-lighthouse-viewer): A wrapper of the lighthouse-viewer for React.

If you want a wrapper in for another library/framework, just open an issue ;)
